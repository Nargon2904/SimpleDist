# Audio plugin for processing guitar sound
Here i attached the code in C++ and files of the plugin.

Open the .exe file, to make it work. For opening .vst3 format file use an audio sequencer.
The plugin works in .vst3 format, as well as in standalone application. But personally i recomend using audio sequencer and opening .vst3 file, because standalone app may not see your audio driver(as it was in my case)

The plugin was made by applying JUCE framework and using an audio sequensor.
